v0.5
Fixed dome/underground lag.
Tweaked timing of die off to have a better trail on faster speeds.
Mod options to shrub on mouse postion, delay shrubbing, die off delay.

v0.4
Growth when cursor stopped.
Stopped growth in domes and underground as it's laggy.
Actually it's laggy even when near domes.
I thought lights, but even with no shadows on them it still happens?

v0.3
Now uses either mouse or gamepad for positions.

v0.2
Evans update.
